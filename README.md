# Specs framework

This is a simple framework that provides a mechanism to define and produce specifications that can be joined together using the operands: AND, OR, XOR, NOT.  This framework attempts to produce an implementation of a specification framework as described by the [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern).

The main usage example is provided by the [IntegrationTest](src/test/java/me/isw/specs/IntegrationTest.java).  The sample specification elements and rules are provided in the [samples package](src/test/java/me/isw/specs/samples).
